### INTRODUCTION
   A person’s mental well-being is his or her mental condition, as well as an overview of his or her general environment. Brain chemistry abnormalities are the cause of mental illness. An individual’s mental health serves as a barometer for properly addressing his or her diseases. To predict any health-related irregularities, it is critical to keep track of diverse groups’ mental health profiles.
